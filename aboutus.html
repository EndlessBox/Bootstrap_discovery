          <p>
            Started in 2010, Ristorante con Fusion quickly established itself as
            a culinary icon par excellence in Hong Kong. With its unique brand
            of world fusion cuisine that can be found nowhere else, it enjoys
            patronage from the A-list clientele in Hong Kong. Featuring four of
            the best three-star Michelin chefs in the world, you never know what
            will arrive on your plate the next time you visit us.
          </p>
          <p>
            The restaurant traces its humble beginnings to
            <em class="text-muted">The Frying Pan</em>, a successful chain
            started by our CEO, Mr. Peter Pan, that featured for the first time
            the world's best cuisines in a pan.

          <p class="d-none d-sm-block">
            Our CEO, Peter, credits his hardworking East Asian immigrant parents
            who undertook the arduous journey to the shores of America with the
            intention of giving their children the best future. His mother's
            wizardy in the kitchen whipping up the tastiest dishes with whatever
            is available inexpensively at the supermarket, was his first
            inspiration to create the fusion cuisines for which
            <em>The Frying Pan</em> became well known. He brings his zeal for
            fusion cuisines to this restaurant, pioneering cross-cultural
            culinary connections.

          <p class="d-none d-sm-block">
            Our CFO, Danny, as he is affectionately referred to by his
            colleagues, comes from a long established family tradition in
            farming and produce. His experiences growing up on a farm in the
            Australian outback gave him great appreciation for varieties of food
            sources. As he puts it in his own words,
            <em
              >Everything that runs, wins, and everything that stays, pays!</em

            Blessed with the most discerning gustatory sense, Agumbe, our CTO,
            personally ensures that every dish that we serve meets his exacting
            tastes. Our chefs dread the tongue lashing that ensues if their dish
            does not meet his exacting standards. He lives by his motto,
            <em>You click only if you survive my lick.</em>
